## Description

PokeTrade is a web application exclusively designed for Pokemon fans.   
Pokemon trainers from all over the world can have their own trainer profile as well as edit it! They can also make a trade list for other trainers to see. This trade list includes the Pokemon you offer and the ones you are interested in. 
PokeTrade also includes a search engine, where you check which trainers have the Pokemon you want in your team, so that you can contact them for trades and catch them all!
